4) Though the game is pretty simple, it managed to surprise me , to be honest. It brings back memories of my childhood when we could spend hours playing our favourite game on a little gadget that not everyone could afford. Once to open it was enough to get completely obsessed with the game and to forget about time. Even now, when I have so many ways to have fun and joy, I sometimes still think about forgetting of existence of problems in my life. (Erboto)

9) I will criticize the work which was created by Elira and Sezim. Their game is awesome! I'm delighted that they can do this! Everything is in place! It is very easy and convenient to use! And very Interesting game . I like it! But, In my opinion you need to add some features like you can change the level and make the font bigger too! (Nuriza)
10) Honestly, this game brought me back to my sweet childhood days, when me and my brother used to compete in Guessing to beat each other's score. And now I want to thank Sezim Ydyrysova and Elira Akimbaeva for getting a chance to experience that again! Tetris is simple, but makes me want to reach higher score over and over, that I can't get enough of it! (Aidina)
